\title{SvMF Parameterisations}
\usage{
SvMFcann(k, a, G)

SvMFmuV(k, m, a1, V)
}
\description{
The SvMF canonical parameterisation is a set of positive real numbers (kappa, \code{a}) and a matrix of orthonormal column vectors \code{Gamma}, where the product of the \code{a} is 1. \code{a_1} and \code{kappa} are not jointly estimatable by MLE, so I'm expecting them to be closely related.
There are three other parametrisations.
Alternatively this set of numbers are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix E(yy^T). The determinant of this matrix would be kappa * a_1.
A third parametrisation is available: using kappa, mu and a matrix V that is symmetric positive definite matrix with det(V) = 1.
A fourth represents the above V matrix as an orthogonal matrix and a set of positive real values.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{SvMFcann()}: The canonical parameterisation of a SvMF using a kappa, a vector and Gamma, as used in equation 7 of Scealy and Wood 2017.

\item \code{SvMFmuV()}: The parameterisation of a SvMF that uses a kappa, mean, a_1, and a symmetric positive definite matrix \code{V} with \code{det(V) = 1}. This parameterisation is defined in equations 8 and 9 of Scealy and Wood 2019.
The log-likelihood using this parameterisation is in equation 11 of Scealy and Wood 2019.
