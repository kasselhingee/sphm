\usage{
mobius_vMF(
  y,
  xs = NULL,
  xe = NULL,
  start = NULL,
  type = "SpEuc",
  fix_qs1 = FALSE,
  fix_qe1 = (type == "LinEuc"),
  intercept = TRUE,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A matrix of unit vectors, each row corresponds to a single unit vector.}

\item{xs}{A matrix of spherical covariate vectors (also unit vectors), each row corresponds to the same row in \code{y}.}

\item{xe}{A matrix of Euclidean covariate vectors, each row corresponds to the same row in \code{y}.}

\item{start}{is a starting parameter object. For LinEuc mean link the Qe matrix must have an extra row and column that at the front/top, with 1 in the first entry (and zero elsewhere).}

\item{type}{Specify the link type ("SpEuc" or "LinEuc")}

\item{fix_qs1}{Fix qs1 to the starting values.}

\item{fix_qe1}{Fix qe1 to the starting values - typically used in when "LinEuc" link used.}

\item{intercept}{\code{TRUE} to include a Euclidean intercept term using a covariate that is always \code{1}. This is needed for centering of Euclidean covariates, which is part of standardising the covariates. If \code{intercept = FALSE} then the Euclidean covariates will not be standardised.}

\item{lb}{Passed to \code{\link[=nloptr]{nloptr()}}. Usually not used.}

\item{ub}{Passed to \code{\link[=nloptr]{nloptr()}}. Usually not used.}

\item{...}{Passed as options to \code{\link[=nloptr]{nloptr()}}.}

\description{
Regression of spherical response with vMF error and scaled Mobius link \code{\link[=mnlink]{mnlink()}}.
}
\details{
Optimisation of link parameters is by maximising
\deqn{\sum_i=1^n y_i^T \mu(x_i)}
where \eqn{y_i} are observed unit vectors and \eqn{\mu(x_i)} is the corresponding predicted unit vector.
The concentration of the vMF is then estimated from the residuals.

Uses \code{nloptr}.

Before fitting, rotates y, xs and xe into standard form. If supplied, \code{start}, is updated accordingly.

If \code{type == "LinEuc"} a column of zeros called \code{'dummyzero'} is added to the front of \code{xe}.
