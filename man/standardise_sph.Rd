\title{Standardise Spherical Data}
\usage{
standardise_sph(y, tG = t(secondmoment_mat(y)))

secondmoment_mat(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Matrix of row vectors representing data on the sphere as unit vectors in Cartesian coordinates.}

\item{tG}{The transpose of the estimated second-order moment matrix generated by \code{\link[=secondmoment_mat]{secondmoment_mat()}}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimension as \code{y}.
}
\description{
Rotate spherical data according to the eigenvectors of the second moment of the data
projected perpendicular to the mean direction. Standardised data have mean of (1, 0, 0,...). See Scealy and Wood (2019, Section 4.1.3) for details.
}
\details{
Each returned data point is \code{tG \%*\% y} of the original data point y. The mean direction of this returned data will be (1, 0, 0, ...) and \code{\link[=secondmoment_mat]{secondmoment_mat()}} of this standardised data will return the identity matrix.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{secondmoment_mat()}: Returns a matrix with columns that are the mean direction and then eigenvectors of \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i y_i^\top} projected orthogonal to the mean.
