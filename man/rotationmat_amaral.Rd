\title{The Amaral et al rotation matrix}
\usage{
rotationmat_amaral(start, end)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{Starting location as a unit vector}

\item{end}{End location as a unit vector.}
}
\value{
A matrix
}
\description{
The rotation matrix from Amaral et al (2007, Lemma 2) is very convenient for performing parallel transport on the sphere. When applied to a tangent vector at \code{start} performs parallel transport along geodesics. When applied to the starting location \code{start}, it returns the end locaton \code{end}.
}
\details{
if \code{-start} = \code{end} then a reflection matrix in the \code{end} direction is returned.
