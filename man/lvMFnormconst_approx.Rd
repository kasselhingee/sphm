\title{Approximation of the vMF normalising constant
Helper function lvMFnormconst_approx
For p == 3 using an exact formula
Otherwise uses \emph{approximations} of the modified Bessel function of the first order.
The normalising constant is \eqn{(2 * \pi)^{p/2} besselI(k, p/2 - 1)/k^{p/2 -1}}
where \eqn{p} is the dimension of the ambient space of the sphere (i.e. vectors have \eqn{p} entries)}
\usage{
lvMFnormconst_approx(kappa, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{kappa}{Concentration parameter}

\item{p}{Dimension of ambient space (i.e. length of unit vectors).}

\details{
Returns the log of the normalising constant.
The approximation uses a threshold of 10 to choose between the small concentration and large concentration regime,
and in each regime the series order used is 15.
